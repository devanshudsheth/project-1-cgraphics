Complete Exercises 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 in the textbook pages 26-29 as 
your homework, i.e. write a Java program for each exercise. Put 
the 3 Java source programs in a ZIP file. Submit your ZIP file 
through eLearning before the due time.

Note: with Ex. 1.4, you should try to minimize the number of
lines that are drawn more than once. You can see the repeated
lines by using a different foreground color for each round of 
drawing, or better, by using the XOR writing mode with the
foreground color being black (if you know how to use XOR mode).
